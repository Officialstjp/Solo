   - Streaming response capability
   - Error handling and graceful fallbacks

3. **Model Management System**
   - Automatic model discovery in configured directories
   - Metadata extraction for parameter size, quantization, context length
   - Support for multiple model families (Mistral, Llama, TinyLlama, Phi, Mixtral)
   - Model validation and compatibility checking

4. **Prompt Template System**
   - Format-specific templates for different model families
   - Customizable system prompts for different use cases
   - Chat history formatting and context management
   - Response sanitization for clean outputs

5. **Response Caching**
   - In-memory LRU cache for frequent queries
   - File-based persistence with JSON serialization
   - TTL-based expiration policy
   - Cache management utilities for clearing and refreshing

6. **Configuration System**
   - Pydantic models for configuration validation
   - Environment variable support
   - Command-line parameter overrides
   - Sensible defaults for quick setup

7. **Database Integration**
   - PostgreSQL with time-based partitioning
   - Migration system for schema updates
   - Connection pooling for efficient resource usage
   - Transaction management and error handling

8. **Security Services**
   - Argon2 password hashing
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Password policy enforcement
   - Session management

9. **API Layer**
   - FastAPI server with OpenAPI documentation
   - Endpoint routes for all core services
   - Authentication middleware
   - Rate limiting and request validation
   - Error handling and standardized responses

10. **Testing Infrastructure**
    - Pytest framework for unit and integration tests
    - Test utilities for API endpoint validation
    - Database testing with transactions
    - Mocking framework for external dependencies

#### Features In Progress

1. **Memory and RAG Integration**
   - pgvector extension for PostgreSQL vector storage
   - Text embedding generation with sentence-transformers
   - Semantic search for relevant context retrieval
   - Document chunking and processing pipeline
   - Context injection for enhanced responses

2. **Dashboard UI**
   - Initial Streamlit implementation
   - Basic system metrics visualization
   - Model management interface
   - Conversation history viewer

#### Planned Features

1. **Speech Components**
   - STT using faster-whisper for real-time transcription
   - TTS using Piper for natural-sounding voice output
   - Voice activity detection for conversation flow
   - Wake word detection with Porcupine

2. **Agent Orchestration**
