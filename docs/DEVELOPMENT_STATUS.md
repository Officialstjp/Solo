   - Model validation and compatibility checking

4. **Prompt Template System**
   - Format-specific templates for different model families
   - Customizable system prompts for different use cases
   - Chat history formatting and context management
   - Response sanitization for clean outputs

5. **Response Caching**
   - In-memory LRU cache for frequent queries

   - Environment variable support
   - Command-line parameter overrides
   - Sensible defaults for quick setup

7. **Database Integration**
   - PostgreSQL with time-based partitioning
   - Migration system for schema updates
   - Connection pooling for efficient resource usage
   - Transaction management and error handling

8. **Security Services**
   - Argon2 password hashing
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Password policy enforcement
   - Session management

9. **API Layer**
   - FastAPI server with OpenAPI documentation
